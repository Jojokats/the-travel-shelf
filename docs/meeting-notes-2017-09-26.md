## Preface
- Discussion on last weeks exercise:
  - Many technologies/languages were researched along with Pro's and Con's of each one.
  - It was decided our project would use Node/express with React (or Preact)
  - Nodeschool is a great place to get up and running with node.
    - If using a template, be careful to choose a modern one.

## Agenda
- Solidify our vision for the project
- Determine/discuss core functionality

## Meeting  
_start time approximately 10:15am_
- Several variant of the project's value proposition were discussed:
  - A piece of ART
  - A Database of indie bookstores
  - Tap into niche community by being _cool_ & Informative (ex: vanity fair)
- There are many direction the project could take, each with their own trade offs.
    - Choosing to focus on one vs another has a direct impact on the best stack.
    - For example, focusing on users would require authorization, commenting/messaging etc.
    - Focusing on sales for bookstore owners would require online market place...
    - Are we focusing on: ? ( users / content / user / owner )  
- A discussion was held on a variety of possible features including:
  - User comments (extra complexity)
  - Possible layout with lots of dynamic content
  - reviews...
- It was determined that we should *start simple*, build a solid base, and go from there.
- The website will be *over-engineered* to allow for more complex features at a later date.
- V1:
  - Homepage with featured bookstore (monthly?)
  - Bookstore index page with map & dynamic icons / list of bookstores
  - Blog page for news

  -  Message board / user comments will be off site (facebook?)
- V2: Could allow users to create a profile, receive contact based on their location and sign up for newsletters?
- Customer/user reviews could be implemented in a future version.
- Homework:
  - Create a simple app in Node
  - Visit an indie bookstore :) 
- end of  11:40
